# BE562 Automating Nephritis Detection in Kidney Biopsies Using Nuclei Segmentation and GMMs

## MANA
Written in MATLAB R2018a

The MANA code includes three files. Due to lack of clarity in the MANA paper, the algorithm we reproduced can either have a slow runtime or much faster runtime. The code located here is the slower version that was run on the SCC to segment kidney tissue slices. If you would like the faster version, please contact me. 

To generate nuclei centers, run MANA.m
